# VideoStab

A simple video stabilisation for Android, based on:
* https://learnopencv.com/video-stabilization-using-point-feature-matching-in-opencv/
* https://github.com/spmallick/learnopencv/tree/master/VideoStabilization

WARNING:
* Work is still in progress

Output video:
* Use MJPEG encoder (the only OpenCV encoder available for now on Android)
* My default video player don't play it, but I can play it with MX Player for example (or on desktop)
